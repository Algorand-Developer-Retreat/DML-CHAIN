# DML-Chain: Decentralizing Machine Learning with Blockchain

DML-Chain introduces a novel architecture that integrates blockchain technology with federated learning to decentralize machine learning. This approach mitigates key challenges such as data centralization, privacy breaches, and biases in training datasets. By leveraging blockchain's secure, decentralized ledger and federated learning's privacy-preserving capabilities, DML-Chain enables distributed model training without requiring centralized data repositories.

## Key Features
- **Privacy-first Training:** Data remains on local devices, preserving user privacy while enabling collaborative training.
- **Blockchain Accountability:** Blockchain records ensure transparency and track participant contributions securely.
- **Smart Contract Incentives:** An incentive mechanism rewards high-quality contributions while penalizing malicious behaviors.
- **Energy Efficiency:** Implemented on a carbon-negative blockchain(Algorand) to ensure sustainability and scalability.

The projectâ€™s proof-of-concept demonstrates the potential for a secure, privacy-preserving ecosystem that fosters collaboration in machine learning while reducing bias and maintaining accountability.

## Status
This project is currently in **active development**. Future updates will focus on optimizing blockchain integration, improving model performance, and expanding real-world applications.
